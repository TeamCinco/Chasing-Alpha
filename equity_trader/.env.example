# .env file for Schwab API Trader Script

# --- REQUIRED: Schwab API Credentials ---
# Get these from your App on the Charles Schwab Developer Portal
SCHWAB_APP_KEY="YOUR_CLIENT_ID_FROM_SCHWAB_DEVELOPER_PORTAL"
SCHWAB_APP_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_SCHWAB_DEVELOPER_PORTAL"

# --- REQUIRED: Callback URL ---
# This MUST exactly match one of the Callback URLs registered in your Schwab App.
# For local testing, https://127.0.0.1 is common if you registered it.
# Schwab typically requires HTTPS, even for localhost.
SCHWAB_CALLBACK_URL="https://127.0.0.1"


# --- OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: Your Schwab Account Number ---
# Provide your regular Schwab account number (e.g., 1234-5678 or just 12345678).
# The script will use this to find the correct encrypted account hash if you have multiple accounts
# or if SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH is not set.
SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_NUMBER="12345678"


# --- OPTIONAL: Directly Set Encrypted Account Hash ---
# If you know your encrypted account hash (you can get it by running `python trader.py get_accounts` once),
# you can set it here. If this is set, the script will use it directly,
# potentially skipping the lookup using SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_NUMBER.
# SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH="abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"


# --- OPTIONAL: Default Trading Parameters ---
# These can be overridden by command-line arguments in trader.py
# SCHWAB_DEFAULT_DURATION="DAY"           # Examples: DAY, GOOD_TILL_CANCEL
# SCHWAB_DEFAULT_SESSION="NORMAL"         # Examples: NORMAL, AM, PM, SEAMLESS


# --- OPTIONAL: Logging Level ---
# Controls the verbosity of log messages.
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
SCHWAB_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"


# --- OPTIONAL: Token File Path ---
# If you want to store the schwab_tokens.json file in a different location.
# Default is 'schwab_tokens.json' in the same directory as the script.
# SCHWAB_TOKEN_FILE="/path/to/your/custom/schwab_tokens.json"
